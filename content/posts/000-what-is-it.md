Hi everyone!

Half a month ago I was in one book shop in Budapest where I bought an amazing book. The book that can finally satisfy my curiosity in both Hungarian and German languages. It's named “Hogy mondjunk németül?“ (~ “How to speak German?“).

What I'm going to do is to publish bilingual texts from the book few times a week, giving simultaneously an English translation, too. There're in general 290 entries so it should be done the way that by the end of the year all the entries are considered.

Kezdjük! Fangen wir an! Let's go!
