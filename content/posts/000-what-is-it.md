Hi everyone!

Half a month ago I was in one book shop in Budapest where I bought an amazing book. The book that can finally satisfy my curiosity in both Hungarian and German languages. It's named “Hogy mondjunk németül?“ (~ “How to speak German?“).

What I'm going to do is to publish bilingual texts from the book few times a week, giving simultaneously an English translation, too. There're in general 290 entries so it should be done the way that by the end of the year all the entries are considered.

The goals I personally pursue are the following:

* Become proficient in typing Hungarian and German using the corresponding keyboard layouts
* Learn new words and phrases in both languages
* Accustom myself to natural-sounding syntax and stylistics
* Practise in pronunciation
* Play around a powerful blog engine called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
* Have fun spending my time on the things I really love :)

Kezdjük! Fangen wir an! Let's go!
