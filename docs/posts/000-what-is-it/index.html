Half a month ago I was in one book shop in Budapest where I bought an amazing book. The book that can finally satisfy my curiosity in both Hungarian and German languages. It&#39;s named “Hogy mondjunk németül?“ (~ “How to speak German?“).
What I&#39;m going to do is to publish bilingual texts from the book few times a week, giving simultaneously an English translation, too. There&#39;re in general 290 entries so it should be done the way that by the end of the year all the entries are considered." />

			<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>Half a month ago I was in one book shop in Budapest where I bought an amazing book. The book that can finally satisfy my curiosity in both Hungarian and German languages. It's named “Hogy mondjunk németül?“ (~ “How to speak German?“).</p>
<p>What I'm going to do is to publish bilingual texts from the book few times a week, giving simultaneously an English translation, too. There're in general 290 entries so it should be done the way that by the end of the year all the entries are considered.</p>
<p>The goals I personally pursue are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Become proficient in typing Hungarian and German using the corresponding keyboard layouts</li>
<li>Learn new words and phrases in both languages</li>
<li>Accustom myself to natural-sounding syntax and stylistics</li>
<li>Practise in pronunciation</li>
<li>Play around a powerful blog engine called <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a></li>
<li>Have fun spending my time on the things I really love :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Kezdjük! Fangen wir an! Let's go!</p>
